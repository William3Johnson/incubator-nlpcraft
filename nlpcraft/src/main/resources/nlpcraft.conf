# This is joint configuration file for both the server and the data probes. Note that
# server and probe configuration can be placed into separate files - each file containing only
# 'nlpcraft.server' or 'nlpcraft.probe' sub-sections.
#
# You can also provide configuration properties or override the default ones via environment variables.
# To use environment variables override:
# 1. Set probe or server JVM system property -Dconfig.override_with_env_vars=true
# 2. For each configuration 'x.y.z' set the environment variable CONFIG_FORCE_x_y_z=some_value
#
# Examples of environment variables:
#   -- Overrides 'nlpcraft.sever.host' configuration property.
#   CONFIG_FORCE_nlpcraft_server_rest_host="localhost"
#
#   -- Overrides 'nlpcraft.sever.models' configuration property.
#   CONFIG_FORCE_nlpcraft_server_models="com.models.MyModel"
